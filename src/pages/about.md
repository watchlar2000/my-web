### Hello!

<div class="cluster |  photo-block">
  <p>
    My name's Sergii and I craft web applications that are fast, accessible, good looking and delightful to use.
  </p>
  <div class="photo-block__image avatar-image">
    {% themeImage {alt: "Sergii portrait", lightSource: "src/images/theme/avatar-black.png", darkSource: "src/images/theme/avatar-white.png"} %}
  </div>
</div>

While I have extensive React experience, I also like working with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) because of their developer experience and performance. I'm also experimenting with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

My toolkit includes TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and various ORMs like DrizzleORM, Objection, and Knex. I'm passionate about modern CSS features, Fluid Typography, and Tailwind CSS. Andy Bell's ["Complete CSS"](https://piccalil.li/complete-css/) course changed my perspective completely and made me truly care about both the development process flow and how to utilize CSS effectively.

Beyond day-to-day coding, I'm fascinated by functional programming. I'm always looking to expand my horizons through books, podcasts, blogs and courses.

**Podcast recommendation:** I recently discovered [RWpod](https://www.rwpod.com/) that I wanted to share with you. Even though it's mostly about Ruby, it also showcases new web features and JavaScript-related content.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me riding my bicycle, brewing coffee (shoutout to [Radiokava](https://www.radiokava.com.ua/) â€” my favorite roastery), playing PlayStation games, or staying active with CrossFit and running, my latest sporting obsession.
