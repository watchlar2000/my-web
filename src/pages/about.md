### Hello!

<div class="cluster |  photo-block">
  <p>
  I'm Sergii - a JavaScript developer who enjoys building things. Along with having an elegant taste in design, I craft robust and accessible frontends, and solve backend challenges.
  </p>
  <div class="photo-block__image avatar-image">
  {% themeImage {alt: "Sergii portrait", lightSource: "src/images/theme/avatar-black.png", darkSource: "src/images/theme/avatar-white.png"} %}
  </div>
</div>

I've worked with React the most, but I've found myself drawn more to Vue and Svelte for their elegance and developer experience. Also, I've been trying SolidJS. On the backend, I like working with Node.js and Fastify. As well, my toolkit includes TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and various ORMs like DrizzleORM, Objection, and Knex.

I'm passionate about modern CSS — CSS Grid and Flexbox, Fluid Typography, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS. Andy Bell's ["Complete CSS"](https://piccalil.li/complete-css/) course changed my perspective completely. I can't thank him enough. Since I came across his content, it just hits right at the point every time - check out Andy Bell.

Beyond the day-to-day coding, I'm fascinated by functional programming and architectural principles. I'm always looking to expand my horizons though books, podcasts, blogs and courses.

**Podcast recommendation:** I recently discovered [RWpod](https://www.rwpod.com/) that I wanted to share with you. Even though it's mostly about Ruby, it also showcases new web features and JavaScript-related content.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me riding my bicycle, brewing coffee (shoutout to [Radiokava](https://www.radiokava.com.ua/) — my favorite roastery), playing PlayStation games, or staying active with CrossFit and running, my latest sporting obsession.
