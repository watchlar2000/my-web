## Learning

Learning is like a breath of fresh air, so I try to pick up new things regularly. I've got so many books to read, a few courses to take, and a bunch of videos to watch. However, after getting trapped in tutorial hell multiple times, I'm changing tactics - one month per topic.

I'm challenging myself to become a better TypeScript developer with help of the following resources:

- Book: Programming TypeScript by Boris Cherny.
- Course: [TypeScript Training - Intermediate v2](https://www.typescript-training.com/course/intermediate-v2)

## Music

When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to music. My favorite bands are Songs: Ohia (and other Jason Molina projects) and The Radio Dept. I discover new music on Spotify and track my listening habits on Last.fm to keep my music metrics.

The last liked song: [Yukimi, Little Dragon - Get It Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L82PGSYVJIM)
