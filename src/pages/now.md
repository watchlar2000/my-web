### Wait, what "/now" page?

At the beginning of my web development journey, I came across the "/now" page idea and thought that it would be great to implement it on my own website (it was my long-lasting dream to build a personal website). If you're curious, you can read more about it [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

In short, "/now" is a specific page that lets you look behind the curtain of a person's life. If you're still reading (which I really appreciate), here's a few things about my today's life.

### What am I learning now?

Learning is like a breath of fresh air. This site has been published and is getting its popularity (just kidding). I'm now focusing on TypeScript. I challenge myself to become a better TS.

### Leasure time?

I enjoy listening to music. My fav bands are Songs: Ohia (and other Jason Molina's projects) and The Radio Dept. I use Spotify to find the gems and Last.fm to keep my music metrics.
